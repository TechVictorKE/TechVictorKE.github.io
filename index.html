        <h1>My Favourite Band of All Time</h1>
        <h2>Green Day</h2>
        <p class="introduction">
            Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist <strong>Joe Armstrong</strong> and bassist and backing vocalist <strong>Mike Dirnt</strong>.<br>
            For much of the band's career, they have been a trio with drummer <strong>Tré Cool</strong>, who replaced <em>John Kiffmeyer</em> in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, <em>Kerplunk (1991)</em>.<br>
            Touring guitarist <em>Jason White</em> became a full-time member in 2012, but returned to his role as a touring member in 2016. Green Day was originally part of the late-'80s/early-'90s punk scene at the DIY 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut Dookie, released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day is credited alongside fellow California punk bands NOFX, Sublime, Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, and Jawbreaker with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.

            Though the albums Insomniac (1995), Nimrod (1997), and Warning (2000) did not match the success of Dookie, they were still successful with the former two reaching double platinum status while the latter achieved gold. Green Day's seventh album, a rock opera called American Idiot (2004), found popularity with a younger generation selling six million copies in the U.S. Their next album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009 and achieved the band's best chart performance. It was followed by a trilogy of albums, ¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, and ¡Tré!, released in September, November, and December 2012, respectively. The trilogy did not perform as well as expected commercially in comparison to their previous albums largely due to lack of promotion and Armstrong entering rehab. Their twelfth studio album, Revolution Radio, was released in October 2016 and became their third to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. The band's thirteenth studio album, Father of All Motherfuckers, was released on February 7, 2020.

        <h2>Controversies</h2>
        <p class="controversies">
            On September 21, 2012, while Green Day was performing at the iHeartRadio music festival, Armstrong stopped while performing "Basket Case" because he believed the group's time was being shortened, possibly to extend R&B artist Usher's performance.
            Angered, Armstrong began ranting while a screen in the rear of the audience was labeled "1 Minutes Left", saying "You're gonna give me one fucking minute? You've gotta be fucking kidding me!"
            He also told the crowd he "was not Justin Bieber" and labeled the festival as a "joke". When the screen went blank, Armstrong smashed his guitar while bassist Mike Dirnt smashed his bass.
            Armstrong then gave the finger, and declared that Green Day would be back before throwing his microphone down and walking off the stage.
